<h1>Connection Instrument SDK &ndash; Change History</h1>
<!--
	<dt>0.2.0.x &ndash; in progress</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li>.</li>
	</ul></dd>
-->
<dl>
	<dt>2020/11/19 &ndash; SDK version: 6.8.0</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Added signal array functionality.</li>
		<li> TestClient and VcTestClient example projects were edited to show usage of new ConnectionClient function cxcGetActionData</li> 
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2014/11/07 &ndash; SDK version: 6.1.0</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Added 64-bit client dll and updated samples for 64-bit.</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2013/01/08 &ndash; SDK version: 6.0.0</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Changed version to follow BioGraph version.</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2012/12/19 &ndash; SDK version: 4.0.0</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Changed the way clients and Biograph work. There is no ConnectionServer.dll. Biograph uses new TTConnectionServer.dll.</li>
		<li> New features: Biograph sends session type (Recording/Replay) as well as real session states (Running/Pause/Stopped/Frozen).</li>
		<li> Now it is possible to have more than one client on the same PC connected to Biograph.</li>
		<!-- but: only if they use the same tcp port. -->
		<li> Most samples in SDK have been updated to display new functionality.</li>
		<li> For detailed description of new features and new functionality, read Connection Instrument SDK.doc</li>
		<li> 2012/11 : new client API fixed so that old clients recompile without error and still work correctly if new sdk is used.</li>
		<li> 2012/12 : updated ServerSimulator to allow testing the new functionality.</li>
		<li> 2012/12 : new client dll fixed to be a drop-in replacement of older client dlls.</li>
		<li> 2012/12 : new client dll fixed to communicate with older versions of BioGraph.</li>
		<!-- todo: update ServerSimulator to allow testing behavior of older versions of BioGraph -->
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2010/03/11 &ndash; SDK version: 3.0.3</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> ConnectionServer.dll version changed to 5.1.0(no changes in the code!)</li>
		<li> ConnectionClient.dll. Fixed Bug: producers do not handle properly the "Ready" message, g_pConsumer->SignalReady(), when they are too busy. Fix: send the ready message repeatedly until data is received. If we do not do this, Biograph would act as there is no application connected to it.It happens only if there is really "heavy" screen with long initialization.</li>
		<li> If you use ConnectionClient dll, you do not need to fix your application. Just take new ConnectionClient dll.If you used ConnectionServer dll, you have to fix your application. We fixed a SampleFlashPlayer to show the way to fix your app.(if you need it)</li>
		<li> Added new definitions in manifests of some projects(for Vista and Windows7 compliancy: DPI aware and Vista/Windows7 compatible).</li>
		<li> Removed personal contact info from SDK doc. Replaced with research@thoughttechnology.com</li>
		<li> Added SDK History.htm to SDK package. Section with changes in SDK doc is removed and refers to htm file.</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2009/11/02 &ndash; SDK version: 3.0.2</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Minor fixes in ConnectionServer.dll.(the same dll is used by Biograph(working version 5.0.4) ). Updated binaries for ServerSimulator so it would work exactly like Biograph 5.1: new changes: it is possible to connect on the fly to Biograph (or ServerSimulator) which has been already started and to get all the data: client ID, all scales thresholds. Before, to get all the information it was necessary to establish connection before starting Biograph (ServerSimulator).</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2009/05/04 &ndash; SDK version: 3.0.1</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Renamed TTFlashPlayer to SampleFlashPlayer. As we are going to have our own product TTFlashPlayer.</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2008/07/26 &ndash; SDK version: 3.0.0</dt>
	<dd><ul>
		<li> Upgraded all sample projects to Visual Studio 2005.</li>
		<li> ConnectionServer.dll and ConnectionClient.dll also compiled with VS 2005.</li>
		<li> ConnectionServer.dll version changed to 4.2.0.</li>
		<li> Removed functionality to send custom messages from XML file (tag &lt;Messages&gt;) from Server to Clients.(since we do not compile dlls in Unicode, but Main application is in Unicode).</li>
		<li> Corresponding Biograph Infiniti version 4.5</li>
		<li> Added new &lt;Path&gt; and &lt;Parameters&gt; tags into xml file used by connection Instrument.Now users should not put their executables into Externals folder.CI will read path to exe from xml.</li>
		<li> Added new utility program (AddPath.exe) that could be used to add &lt;Path&gt; tag into xml file.</li>
	</ul></dd>

		<li> ConnectionServer.dll version 1.0.0.No change!</li>
		<li> Corresponding Biograph Infiniti version 4.0</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>2007/03/15 &ndash; SDK version: 1.0.0</dt>
